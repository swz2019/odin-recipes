        <p>
            This is a meatball recipe from FitMenCook. It is a healthy option for meatballs using turkey and quinoa.
            It is a high protein low fat dish you can add to most base carbs.

            I found the recipe 2 years ago and have been making it ever since. It is quick and easy to end up  with a tasty lunch or dinner!
